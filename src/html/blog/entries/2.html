                        The process of improving your website to appear higher on search engine results pages is known as search engine optimization, or SEO (SERPs). The higher your website ranks the more likely it is that potential customers will be able to find it. We will go through the fundamentals of SEO and how to increase your website's exposure on Google in this article.

                    <h3 class='scroll scroll__up'>Keyword Analysis</h3>
                    <p class='scroll scroll__up'>
                        Choosing keywords is the first step in optimizing your website. This entails figuring out the search terms and phrases that members of your target market use on Google. The text, meta tags, and URLs of your website should contain these keywords, which should be pertinent to your business.
                    </p>
                    <p class='scroll scroll__up'>
                        Once you've determined your target keywords, it's crucial to use them on your website in critical areas like the header tags, meta description, and the title tag. In addition to making it more likely that your website will appear in search results for certain keywords, this will aid search engines in understanding the content of your website.

                    <h3 class='scroll scroll__up'>On-Page Optimization</h3>
                    <p class='scroll scroll__up'>The measures you can do on your website to increase its exposure on Google are referred to as on-page optimization. Your title tags, meta descriptions, header tags, and content should all be optimized.</p>
                    <h3 class='scroll scroll__up'>Title Tags</h3>
                    <p class='scroll scroll__up'>
                        The text that shows in the browser tab and in the search results is known as a title tag. They ought to be succinct and contain your main keywords. For instance, your title tag should contain the keywords "shoes" and "buy" if your website sells shoes.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class='scroll scroll__up'>Meta Descriptions</h3>
                    <p class='scroll scroll__up'>
                        The summary of your website's content that displays in search results is known as a meta description. In addition to include your target keywords your meta descriptions should be compelling. Often times users will read meta descriptions in the Google search results as they are choosing a link to click on so don't forget to write something that keeps them wanting more
                    </p>
                    <h3 class='scroll scroll__up'>Header Tags</h3>
                    <p class='scroll scroll__up'>The material on your website is organized using header tags, often known as H1, H2, H3, etc. They are utilized to organize your material and incorporate your desired keywords. The content inside your header tags is almost always taken into consideration for SEO purposes so think of the space inside these tags as prime real estate for your keywords.</p>
                    <h3 class='scroll scroll__up'>Content</h3>
                    <p class='scroll scroll__up'>
                        Content is one of the most critical factors for improving search engine rankings and driving traffic to your website. Search engines prioritize content that is fresh, relevant, and valuable to users, which means you need to focus on creating high-quality, informative content that answers your target audience's questions and provides value. Content can come in various forms, such as blog posts, articles, videos, infographics, and more. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        By regularly producing and publishing high-quality content on your website, you increase the likelihood of ranking higher in search engine results pages, attracting more traffic to your site, and ultimately, converting that traffic into loyal customers. Additionally, high-quality content can help establish your business as an authority in your industry, improving your reputation and building trust with your audience.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class='scroll scroll__up'>Off-Page Optimization</h3>
                    <p class='scroll scroll__up'>
                        The term "off-page optimization" describes the steps you can take outside of your website to raise Google's ranking of it. The creation of backlinks, social media, and online directories are all components of off-page optimization efforts.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class='scroll scroll__up'>Backlinks</h3>
                    <p class='scroll scroll__up'>
                        Backlinks are connections to your website made by other websites. They are crucial because they let search engines know that other websites value your material. The more backlinks you receive the better but quality is important. For example a backlink from www.nbc.com helps way more than a backlink from your local NBC affiliate.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class='scroll scroll__up'>Social Media</h3>
                    <p class='scroll scroll__up'>
                        Using social media to promote your website and improve its Google ranking is a terrific idea. Promote your material on social media sites and urge others to do the same.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class='scroll scroll__up'>Online Directories</h3>
                    <p class='scroll scroll__up'>

                    </p>
